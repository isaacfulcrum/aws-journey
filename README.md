# AWS Journey

Welcome to my **AWS Journey** 🚀  
This repository contains all my notes, resources, and study material as I prepare for AWS certifications.  
I decided to make it public to track my progress, share what I learn, and (hopefully) help others on their own path to the cloud.

## 📖 About this Repo
