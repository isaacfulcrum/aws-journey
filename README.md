# AWS Journey

Welcome to my **AWS Journey** ðŸš€  
This repository contains all my notes, resources, and study material as I prepare for AWS certifications.  
I decided to make it public to track my progress, share what I learn, and (hopefully) help others on their own path to the cloud.

## About this Repo
- All notes are written in **Markdown** for readability.  
- Continuously updated as I move forward in my AWS journey.
